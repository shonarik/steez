This repository is all about how I do things. Anything that I want to remember and share belongs here.

## Windows Fresh Install

```
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget
```

* **Install Powershell** via `winget` because that is the recommended way: `winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget`

## Docker Without Docker Desktop

I prefer the command line so Docker Desktop does not offer much advantage. Additionally, it's not clear the switching between Linux and Windows is all that useful - I mean if I want to use a Linux container I just open WSL2. Windows?- well, that's the default.
